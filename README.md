CXL certifications are recognized as valuable credentials for marketers looking to demonstrate their expertise in advanced digital marketing strategies and data-driven decision-making.

According to the platform, you may experience hands-on learning, get practical expertise, and learn from the top 1% of digital marketers on CXL.

Is the platform worth it, though?

## Is CXL worth it?

I get this question a lot "[Is CXL worth it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cxl-review-institute-worth-my-experience-anil-vishwakarma-aqabc/)", I have been using CXL now for almost 2 years and it is worth every penny I spent on it.

It provides more than 100 online CXL courses and certificates in topics including content strategy, digital psychology, and growth marketing.

**[![|624x97](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfWSBCwJjCElU71xI3fDX_2F8tfPOSYHLzPNJltHw5czumSxKTfAUnIOpnEqMhuaSlvJxDjJTUmK6iuqGeWvRtdHr5twUsqdS2wq3-F498nG11CPVk0DVjTtRBqhhwfIm4WwmuaMQ?key=Mb7328mdmQQZ4wcJ5_3CS1Ii)](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview)**

The fact that CXL exclusively provides top-notch, advanced courses taught by professionals from renowned organizations like Google, IKEA, Hilton, Profitwell, and GrowthHackers distinguishes it from other online learning platforms.

As a result, the CXL certificate and minidegree are highly respected and acknowledged in the field.

## What is CXL, and Who is It for?

For anyone looking to advance their knowledge of growth optimization and digital marketing, CXL Institute is the ideal resource.

It provides a distinctive educational experience with its abundance of courses taught by professionals in the field.

Growth marketing and other digital marketing courses and mini-degrees are available on the skill-building platform Conversion XL.

With the goal of assisting optimizers and web designers in developing their abilities, it is intended for a wide spectrum of professionals, from interns to CEOs.

## Review of ConversionXLâ€™s growth marketing courses:

Compared to Google Academy's advanced classes, CXL's basic courses were more useful.

Some people may consider their somewhat expensive All-Access Pass to be a lost opportunity.

The majority of the instructors at CXL Institute excel at both their jobs and their instruction.

Some teachers in grades 1â€“2 are skilled at what they do, but I didn't like the way they taught.

Before enrolling, be aware of the certificate requirements. CXL takes the caliber of their education very seriously.

contrast this with the more than 60 classes I've taken, some of which were free and others of which cost $4,000. To pass, you must correctly answer 90% of the challenging questions.

But seriously, it's among the greatest introductory courses available. There is absolutely no meandering in the videos, which are extremely well-edited and brief.

I've gained a lot from the training at work, and simply by putting the lessons I've learned into practice, I regularly impress my coworkers.

You can search the transcripts of each video. The majority of lessons include reading material, several templates, and downloadable slides.

Without hesitation, the instructors impart everything they know.

## Growth Marketing Mini Degree Review

After watching the full course, I would conclude that it was worthwhile. It was worthwhile even if I hardly finished it.

There aren't many responsibilities after the Minidegree begins.

#1 Examine the recorded content.

You are expected to spend a few hours watching the materials nearly every day. The total amount of video content for my Minidegree was 111 hours.

Approximately 180 to 200 hours are dedicated to course-related activities.

Although you are not required to watch the course every day, it is best to avoid missing more than two days in a row.

When it finally catches up, you have too much to endure. Food loses its flavor and you become distracted. (In reality, that was Corona.)

Some lessons require your whole attention if you wish to understand the material. There are, of course, certain simpler lessons that you want to watch as quickly as possible.

#2 Exams will be given following (almost) every course.

After watching the course, you must take tests and receive more than 90% of the right answers. If you fail, you have six hours to retake the same exam for each course.

You will take 25 to 30 tests for the 33 courses that make up the Mini degree (some courses don't have exams). In actuality, the Mini degree is structured as follows:

There are seven tracks, thirty-three courses, and more than 200 lessons in your mini-degreeâ€”I won't even attempt to count the lessons.

There are multiple courses in each track, and each course has multiple lessons.

You will receive a certificate for that course upon passing each exam. It implies that you will receive numerous certificates.

#3. Write a review article (required for scholarship recipients).

Writing about what you've learned, publishing it, and repeating it are all required.

Every week.

Every student who received free admission with a scholarship must fulfill this prerequisite. Every article you post must be at least 1,000 words long. Additionally, you must publish a total of 12 articles.

On Sunday, the last day of your week cycle, you must publish an article. They welcome each "scholar" with the following email:

You will have one 12-week grace period for late entries, which must be submitted by Wednesday's EOD.

This is your grace period if you receive a warning email; if you don't receive any posts before then, your scholarship will be canceled. â€” CXL

WRONG ðŸ˜ˆ

They are not checking your review articles promptly.

On two occasions, I missed deadlines. On three or four occasions, my pal missed it. We had no warning. However, if you publish too soon, you will be expelled.

However, I do not advise experimenting. merely stating.

Pro Tip: Even if these are clear, Make notes. Save the slide decks locally or on your drive. These will help you pass tests and publish those articles more quickly.

#4 Obtain a passing grade on the final exam.

This final exam is the last result. There are about 80 questions on it, and you have six hours after failing to retake it. The exam will take you about one hour to finish.

Here, the questions are more difficult, and I felt as though a powerful algorithm was putting questions in the courses that I didn't know the answers to.

It's most likely my ignorance rather than that.

Nevertheless, the final exam is more difficult, so you should study for it. Prepare your materials, take out your slides and notes, and unwind. At one point, it becomes exhausting.

Additionally, there is a method to avoid the six-hour wait time for each exam. It was shared a little too late by a guy I met on LinkedIn. Send me a direct message if this is your last week, you're stressed out, and you can't figure it out. (You must provide evidence that this is your final week.)

Pro Tip: Prepare those screenshots of previous exams. Those are useful in this situation.

You shouldn't take this course if

#1 You lack the will to put in the time necessary to make a conscious attempt.

Second, all you want is a certificate.

#3 You anticipate that a job will come up on its own

#4 You lack marketing expertise.

#5 Throughout your career, you want to limit yourself to a single marketing channel.

## Top 3 Teachers & Courses

### 1) Peep Laja: Research and Testing & Conversion Research

Concerning the Instructor: Peep is a successful entrepreneur and an expert in conversion rate optimization. He founded Wynter and CXL Institute and serves as its CEO.

Regarding the course, it primarily explains the components of the Research XL model and how to carry out each stage of the procedure.

Conversion research, surveys, technical analysis, Google Analytics, user testing, and A/B testing are all covered.

What I adored about it:

For anyone interested in conducting conversion research, this course covers 85% of the necessary skills.

Conversion rate optimization and the research process required to perform high-quality CRO are best understood with its help.

Peep is quite sharp. He doesn't mince words and gets right to the point.

### 2) Ton Wesseling: Teaches A/B Mastery

Wesseling is an A/B testing expert. He has over 20 years of experience in this field.

[**Mastery of A/B Testing Course**](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview)

Course duration: 5 hours and 10 minutes, comprising 19 classes

4.7 out of 5 stars

Best practices and A/B testing techniques were covered in my first CXL course.

I have a solid understanding of how to plan, carry out, and evaluate A/B testing for better conversion rates and website optimization.

I've seen a significant rise in the effectiveness of my online marketing and an increase in the number of visitors who turn into clients thanks to the CXL training.
**[![|624x97](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeq9wqGnjE2cmmfbrgQPFitBcIR7PxWrqEB9AsQHFjBLd-L6dVWxTgIew7N4206-QQu0slO7VnM6MAz78-4sEWXqESdL9unOfXQFcCoLs1PzkkiauluT4isiMc6h2jC-VpPpEwFzg?key=Mb7328mdmQQZ4wcJ5_3CS1Ii)](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview)**

### 3) Curt Maly: Advanced Facebook Ads

Concerning the Instructor: Curt is the owner of Black Box Social Media and an authority on Facebook Ads. He talks, advises, and runs several web marketing companies around the United States.

About the Course: The course teaches you how to market what matters to the people who matter and how to properly establish an SMM funnel based on the customer journey.

What I adored about it: This is useful if you have ever used Facebook ads.

This is beneficial for those who have never used Facebook ads.

Again, this is helpful if you want to know what works and what doesn't on Facebook.

If you've been wondering whether Facebook Pixel would survive or not, guess what?

My favorite thing about Curt is that he constantly discusses the big picture while teaching you the specifics. You should follow his instructions to the letter for some reason.

I'm getting off-topic. You are aware of how listening to something for an extended period might occasionally cause your head to drop. When Curt lectures, that doesn't occur.

## CXL is better than free courses and some paid courses

What I regret is this:

I've been on Peep's email list for a while, and I regret not enrolling in this course sooner instead of using Google Analytics and AdWords to take free classes.

In the early days, I didn't adequately store information. However, you are capable of more.

Compared to premium courses like GrowthSchool, CXL is much better. I spent three hundred dollars, and I was furious.

## CXL Pricing Plans Breakdown (2025)

Dissecting the Price Tag

It's time to discuss the expenses. The cost is commensurate with the fact that CXL is not your typical learning platform.

The cost of individual classes is approximately $300, and if you're considering a monthly membership, the monthly cost will be slightly less.

'Yikes, that's a chunk of change!' I understand your thought. But listen to me.

Here, we're not only discussing any old courses. With some of the brightest minds in the industry, we're delving deep into growth hacking and digital marketing.

Here's a summary of the financial situation you're entering:

* [Individual Courses](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview): about $300
* [Membership Fee](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview): Less than $300 a month

Prepare yourself for a $900 commitment if you're thinking about pursuing the CRO mini-degree.

However, keep in mind that you're investing in elite information that could propel your career to new heights before you object to the expense.

You can find cheaper courses (I'm looking at you, $15 'TODAY ONLY' specials), but the value you're getting is quite different. It's like comparing a gourmet meal to fast food.

Is it worth it, then? If you're prepared to put in the effort and are serious about becoming an expert in conversion rate optimization.

This is one investment that requires your whole focus, so be sure you're prepared to invest both time and money

You have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to save up to 60% on your next purchase by utilizing the most recent "[CXL Coupon](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview)" if you're still on the fence about investing in CXL courses or certifications.

## CXL Free Trial and Refund

You can test out **CXL courses for 7 days** before deciding to sign up. You can view all of the content during the trial period and ask for a refund if it doesn't work out.
**[![|624x97](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfWSBCwJjCElU71xI3fDX_2F8tfPOSYHLzPNJltHw5czumSxKTfAUnIOpnEqMhuaSlvJxDjJTUmK6iuqGeWvRtdHr5twUsqdS2wq3-F498nG11CPVk0DVjTtRBqhhwfIm4WwmuaMQ?key=Mb7328mdmQQZ4wcJ5_3CS1Ii)](http://cxl.com/institute?fp_ref=lite&fp_sid=wreview)**

Refunds are not offered after the trial, so it's crucial to make sure it fits your availability and goals.

Throughout the 12-week course, students must devote themselves to finishing weekly tasks and tests.

To determine whether CXL meets your needs and is worth the expense, make good use of the trial.

## Who is CXL not for?

1. Lack of Marketing Experience: To properly comprehend the course material, one needs a basic understanding of marketing.
2. Founders Looking for Fast Fixes: This is not the best option for business owners who want to study marketing rather than employing professionals.
3. Certificate Chasers: Ideal for students who want to become experts in data-driven marketing rather than merely obtain a CXL certification.
4. Non-Tech-Savvy People: Cxl courses require a basic understanding of technology because they use tools and analytics.
5. Senior Professionals: Too simplistic for seasoned marketers who are already familiar with sophisticated tactics.
6. Niche Field Specialists: There are better options available if you're looking for in-depth expertise in fields like Google Ads.

Before spending time and money, please think twice if you checked any two of those six statements.

## CXL Alternatives

Additionally, I have a list of other platforms that I have used and found to be satisfactory in case you feel that CXL is not fulfilling your expectations.

Udacity: In collaboration with businesses like Google and IBM, Udacity provides project-based nanodegree programs in subjects including software development, artificial intelligence, and digital marketing. Career services are included.

Coursera offers top-notch academic courses on a variety of subjects, including data science and business strategy, from prestigious universities like Stanford and Yale.

LinkedIn Learning: Tailored course recommendations that are shown on LinkedIn profiles along with certifications.

DataCamp: Offers practical coding in Python, SQL, and other languages with a focus on data science and analytics.

Skillshare: Short, project-based classes that emphasize creative abilities. Excellent for marketing, the arts, and design.

## CXL Reviews By its Users (Testimonials)

[Trustpilot ](https://www.trustpilot.com/)- User: Amie McS

"The quality of the content is unmatched. The instructors are industry leaders, and the courses on CXL are highly practical. I've implemented what I've learned immediately at work. Worth every penny."

[Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/)- User: DigitalMarketer101

"CXLâ€™s mini-degrees are intense but incredibly thorough. The growth marketing program was a game-changer for my career, especially in understanding data-driven strategies."

Trustpilot - User: Sarah L.

"Itâ€™s pricey, but the insights and depth of information you get are worth it. Perfect for anyone serious about advancing in digital marketing."

## Can I download CXL courses for free?

Because CXL is tactical, their courses require frequent updates.

The issue with this is that you might download already-outdated content. You would have to spend twice as much time learning and relearning things.

* I would suggest CXL's New Scholarship Program if money is tight. They also help you get recruited, which may or may not work, for a one-time price of $100. Once, I attempted to hire someone from their pool, but I was unsuccessful.)
* Choose the $1 plan and quickly review it if you only want to enroll in one or two classes.
* Additionally, CXL posts a lot of stuff on their blog, which I believe covers most of their content, but it's a little overwhelming to read. The blog is free.
* It is ineffective to download CXL content using unapproved means. The content might not be readily available afterward, and it necessitates manually downloading files, which can take time. Furthermore, you lose the capacity to efficiently use files, templates, and transcripts, and this strategy is probably going to lower motivation. For a more seamless learning experience, it makes more sense to use the platform as designed.
* I'm not sure if CXL free courses are good or not. Better to go for the best quality of education out there if time and money constraints can be easily sorted out.

## About Other Minidegrees from CXL

CXL Analytics Minidegree:

The information is out of date. They continue to use UA (as of July 4, 2023) rather than GA4. I got the following feedback:

The industry is moving toward Mixpanel Marketing Analytics and Segmentation, based on my experience with GA and GTM. Even my devs find it difficult to use GTM, so it's no surprise that we will too.

CXL CRO Minidegree:

This minidegree is excellent if learning is the aim. Nothing will ever be out of date. CRO is somewhat owned by the product, though, and it doesn't teach you how to conduct in-product trials.

I don't recall CXL teaching me how to link marketing site data to product KPIs like engagement, retention, and activation metrics.

It's still helpful and a suitable substitute for growth. design course, which costs $1500.

## Conclusion - Conversion XL Review

To sum up, CXL is a good option for marketers who want to acquire advanced, real-world digital marketing abilities.

If you are interested in business and finance themes, the courses are a good investment because they are tough, well-structured, and taught by knowledgeable specialists.

However, CXL might not be the best venue for you if you want to study topics unrelated to these professions.

My expertise in subjects like psychology, statistics, and A/B testing has directly helped me, and I'm now pursuing the CXL CRO mini-degree.

The platform is renowned for offering thorough resources that assist users in improving their proficiency in digital marketing, and well-known businesses like Google and Amazon support its legitimacy.
